# LT - Life tracker <!--change name into something more interesting--> 
<!---Description of the system--->
Life tracker is an application that serves its user in terms of their mental and physical qualities. <!--how--> 
It is a method of tracking one's progress through life and a companion that aids the user along their journey. 
It is a diary and a teacher. It should not be seen as an all-in-one package, nor should it be used as such. One can choose
to make use of only one aspect of the application, if that is what the user needs help with.
<!---I have included every feature present in this documentation since I make use of these features on a daily
basis and they are helpful for me. Having them be present in one application is useful and convenient for me.
As the project evolves, so will the features.--->
